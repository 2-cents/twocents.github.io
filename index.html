				<h2>What is Two Cents?</h2>

					<p>Two Cents is an intentional 10-12 person community focused on the betterment of oneself and one another. The Two Cents creed is &ldquo;For Feedback and Friendship.&rdquo;</p>
				
				<h2>How does it work?</h2>

					<p>Two Cents works a lot like a bank. You invest so that when the time is right, you can withdraw. As you invest your time, energy and even opinions, the community will grow.</p>

					<p>You can sign in and join a discussion. Some groups chat daily, which some might just check in every now and again. The different channels will help guide discussion.</p>

					<p>Feedback is one of the core values of Two Cents, so members should share their work and their opinions. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to give some tough feedback. That&rsquo;s what the group is for.</p>

					<p>Some days, it will be intense critique of a project a member is working on, but some days, it will be a discussion on the best sax solos of the century. Just go with the flow and let your community develop and grow organically.</p>

				<h2>Why was Two Cents formed?</h2>

					<p>There are four reasons why TC was formed:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>The idea of asking 10 friends for feedback all at once was easier and less time consuming than asking them separately.</li>
						<li>Other Slack groups were too large and self-serving and Dribbble wasn&rsquo;t being used for feedback like it used to. There was a need for a small community of trusted eyes.</li>
						<li>Conferences and workshops are great, but when you leave, sometimes you miss out on that community until the next year. We wanted to create a place where community was rooted in in person experiences, but grew during times that we were separate from each other.</li>
						<li>Working in house or freelance can get lonely. Sometime, it&rsquo;s just enough to know that there are some other people right there with you in the process. There&rsquo;s comfort in shared struggles and shared victories.</li>
					</ol>

				<h2>What are the benefits of joining a Two Cents chapter?</h2>

					<p><span class="focus">Selfless Sharing</span> - No one shares their own work to be shared. It must be shared by another TC member, i.e. A member sees another member posted a Dribbble shot. That member may post their friend&rsquo;s shot for all to see. This is important to the structure and culture of TC. You are a member of TC to help others and to be helped, not to toot your own horn.</p>

					<p><span class="focus">Friendship</span> - As you talk with the members on a daily basis, you will likely grow to become friends with these people. That&rsquo;s natural and highly encouraged. The more you trust one another, the more you&rsquo;ll share and the more you&rsquo;ll be willing to help those who share with you.</p>

					<p><span class="focus">Like-Mindedness</span> - Creating channels of things you enjoy bring people together even closer. Whether it&rsquo;s a TV show you and a few other members enjoy or a safe place to share prayer requests, making Two Cents uniquely yours is key.</p>

					<p><span class="focus">Thoughtful &amp; Insightful Feedback</span> - While most things have the ability to be better, delivering feedback can be tricky. Members should be thoughtful, kind and generous with their thoughts. Exploring ways to make something better is always encouraged. Sometimes all it takes is someone sharing how they&rsquo;d solve the problem you&rsquo;re facing. I guarantee that if you&rsquo;re doing this right, you&rsquo;ll see your work get better ten times over.</p>

				<h2>How does someone start a Two Cents chapter?</h2>
				
					<p class="columns">First you’ll need someone to step up the Slack group and start recruiting. Is that you or does that role fit a friend better? Maybe you want to do this with your friend. Regardless, at first it’s all about creating a group of people that are willing and able to commit to being a part of Two Cents. It’s a good idea to discuss Two Cents with your friend before sending them a Slack invite. Helping them understand what’s entailed will help prevent them from backing out later. If you ask someone and they say yes at first but then don’t participate or change their mind, feel free to replace them. It may not be a good fit for everyone and there shouldn’t be any hard feelings! Also, don’t feel the need to get all 10-12 slots filled right away. Be intentional.</p>

				<h2>What are some example channels you have in Slack?</h2>

					<ul>
						<li><span class="focus">#feedback</span> &mdash; post work in progress shots to be reviewed by fellow members</li>
						<li><span class="focus">#fire</span> &mdash; work we find by other artists, designers, illustrators</li>
						<li><span class="focus">#gaming</span> &mdash; video game news/discussions</li>
						<li><span class="focus">#general</span> &mdash; used for announcements, posting other members’ work to share, general discussion</li>
						<li><span class="focus">#jobs</span> &mdash; potential leads or job news</li>
						<li><span class="focus">#movies-and-tv</span> &mdash; movies and tv talk, if there is a movie you would like to talk about specifically with other people who have seen it, another channel is created to avoid spoilers</li>
						<li><span class="focus">#prayer</span> &mdash; safe place to share prayer requests and praises</li>
						<li><span class="focus">#random</span> &mdash; weird discussions, fun finds, not &ldquo;general&rdquo;</li>
						<li><span class="focus">#retreat</span> &mdash; discussions on details regarding future retreats </li>
					</ul>

				<h2>I’ve seen pictures of a yearly retreat. Do you organize that?</h2>

					<p>Each group can do whatever they feel like. One group can organize a weekly or monthly Google Hangout. One group could have some kind of random get together every other year. The original chapter began with yearly retreats to hang out, hike and get more personal...in person!</p>

				<h2>Can I join the original Two Cents chapter?</h2>
					
					<p>No. And not because we’re mean or exclusive but because the magic of a small community is that it is capped at a certain number. We’ve learned that the smaller, the better. There are plenty of talented people out there waiting to be a part of your group.</p>
